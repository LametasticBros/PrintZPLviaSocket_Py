Simple Labelprinter via Socket to ZPL Labelprinter
==

simple python to print multiple lables via ZPL&amp;Socket

Idea
--

 - I use round ~50mm labels @300dpi print witdh is around 600+~5%
 - Scan your drink at the party and get a label for each diffent drink
 - many more functions to come
    - use headless Rpi with Barcodescanner
    - if there is no label for a barcode on drink, print random
