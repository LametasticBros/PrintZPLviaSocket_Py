Simple Labelprinter via Socket to ZPL Labelprinter
==

simple python to print multiple lables via ZPL&amp;Socket

Idea
--

 - I use round ~50mm labels @300dpi print witdh is around 600+~5%
 - Scan your drink at the party and get a label for each diffent drink
 - runs on a pi2, barcode scanner via USBSerial
 - many more functions/ideas to come:
      - add free Beer every n labels
      - move labels to extra files -> autodetect and load random to registered barcodes
      - load labes as bmp, so no more preediting
